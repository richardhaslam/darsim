# Welcome to the DARSim2 Matlab simulator. 

DARSim2 is a Matlab-based 3D reservoir simulator which is aimed at delivering a research and prototype platform for testing new ideas, as well as field-relevant simulation of multiphase flow in natural subsurface formations. 
The key elements that make DARSim2 unique are the following:
1.  It is a comprehensive easy-to-work open-source simulator
2.  It has the state-of-the-art multiscale in space and time implementation
3.  It has the state-of-the-art embedded and projection-based embedded discrete fracture network model implemented in 3D
4.  It has the state-of-the-art adaptive multilevel mesh refinement for both space and time grid
5.  It has fully-implicit and sequential simulation methods
6.  It has compositional effects involved
7.  It solves for flow, transport and heat! So use it for many many geoscientific applications!
8.  Take DARSim2 as a base code, and develop your own MSc or PhD thesis project on it. It saves you 6 years of time!
9.  It is fully based on the published papers of the development team!
10. You can become an official developer! Just contact us: h.hajibeygi@tudelft.nl
