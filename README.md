# Welcome to the DARSim2 Matlab simulator

## What is DARSim2?
DARSim2 is a Matlab-based 3D reservoir simulator which is aimed at delivering a research and prototype platform for testing new ideas, as well as field-relevant simulation of multiphase flow in natural subsurface formations. 
The key elements that make DARSim2 unique are the following:
1.  It is a comprehensive easy-to-work open-source simulator
2.  It has the state-of-the-art multiscale in space and time implementation
3.  It has the state-of-the-art embedded and projection-based embedded discrete fracture network model implemented in 3D
4.  It has the state-of-the-art adaptive multilevel mesh refinement for both space and time grid
5.  It has both fully-implicit and sequential simulation methods
6.  It has a compositional fluid model
7.  It solves for flow, transport and heat! So use it for many many geoscientific applications!
8.  Take DARSim2 as a base code, and develop your own MSc or PhD thesis project on it. It saves you 6 years of time!
9.  It is fully based on the published papers of the development team!
10. It allows for Corner Point Grid Geometry for fine-scale simulations with 3D pEDFM fractures!
